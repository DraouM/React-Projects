```

This diff adds `node_modules` to the `.gitignore` file.  The `+` sign indicates a new line that's been added.   

To apply this change:

1. **If you haven't already**, create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your project.
2. **Open the `.gitignore` file in a text editor.**
3. **Add the line** `node_modules` (if it's not already there).
4. **Save the file.**

Now, the `node_modules` directory will be ignored by Git.
